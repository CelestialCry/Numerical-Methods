# Numerical Methods

First lecture of the course MA2501 held on NTNU

## General Principles of computational mathematics

1. Design a Mathematical model.
    - This is typically a system of equations (linear/nonlinear diff. eq. or integral eq.)

2. Analysis of the model.
    - existence/uniqueness of solutions
    - stability (what happens when parameters or init.conditions changes)
    - invariants and conserved quantities

3. Dscretization of the model
    1. Find the right numerical method to approximate the solutions to the problem.
    2. Implementation in a computer

4. The analysis of the results
    1. Validation against experiment
    2. mathematical analysis of the errors
    3. incorporate feed-back from data in the process
